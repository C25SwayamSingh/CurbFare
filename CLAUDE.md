# CLAUDE.md

Project instructions for Claude and compatible AI assistants.

## Context

This is **food-vendor-platform** — a platform for mobile food vendors and customer discovery. Phase 1 is foundation only.

## Phase 1 Boundaries

Implemented: Next.js scaffold, Tailwind/shadcn, Supabase placeholders, feature folders, landing page, CI, tests.

**Not implemented:** Auth, payments, SMS, maps, loyalty transactions, database schema.

## Loyalty Rules (details in docs/decisions/loyalty-system.md)

- Spend-based points only. Integer cents and integer points; the server is the
  sole authority. Never reintroduce stamps, visits, or punch cards.
- Points come from a **staff-entered** eligible subtotal. A customer never
  types a purchase amount, and no QR scan alone can award anything.
- Two different QRs: the **permanent** vendor QR encodes a public URL and only
  routes; the **dynamic** customer QR is a one-time, 5-minute opaque token
  paired with a 4-digit spoken fallback. Only the token's digest is stored.
- Camera access is requested on explicit tap only; frames never leave the
  device; every exit path stops all MediaStream tracks.

## Location Rules (details in docs/decisions/location-intelligence.md)

- Four states, never collapsed: **VENDOR LIVE**, **SCHEDULED OCCURRENCE**,
  **RECURRING LOCATION**, **LOCATION HOTSPOT**. A hotspot is a _place_, not a
  vendor: never give it an identity, a page link, or the words "Open now" /
  "Live". Only a live session is "Live"; recurring is "Usually here."
- Vendor truth wins: a live session outranks and suppresses that unit's own
  recurring/scheduled predictions. Ranking is haversine — never enable PostGIS.
- Recurring windows are evaluated in the vendor's own timezone (`AT TIME ZONE`).
  Freshness is explicit: live 30 min, recurring 60 days — no confidence score.
- Leads and community reports never auto-promote; they stay `UNVERIFIED` and
  invisible until human review. Public reads go through preview views only;
  reviewer notes and reporter identity are never exposed.

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript strict mode
- App Router conventions (server vs client components)
- Feature modules in `src/features/`
- Mobile-first Tailwind classes
- No secrets in browser bundles

## Design Rules (details in docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)

- Use semantic color tokens only (defined in `src/app/globals.css`); never hardcode hexes or raw Tailwind palette colors in components.
- Orange = actions & live states (ink text on orange, never white). Teal = brand surfaces & selected states. Green `success` ≠ orange `live`.
- Both light and dark palettes are first-class (`prefers-color-scheme`); check changes in both.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
npm run format
npm run format:check
```

## When Product Spec Is Added

1. Read `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md` completely
2. Update `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`, and `docs/BUILD_PHASES.md`
3. Do not add features beyond what the spec supports

See `AGENTS.md` for detailed agent guidelines.
