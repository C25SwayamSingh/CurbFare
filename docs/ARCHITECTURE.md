# Architecture

## Overview

Curbfare (food-vendor-platform) is a production-ready platform for mobile food vendors — food carts, food trucks, stands, and pop-up vendors — and the customers who discover them. Application branding is centralized in `src/lib/app-config.ts`.

Phase 1 established the application foundation. Phase 2 adds authentication, user profiles, organizations (tenants), memberships/roles, MFA foundations, and database-level tenant isolation.

## Authentication & Authorization Layers

Authorization is enforced in three layers; each lower layer assumes the ones
above it can be bypassed:

1. **Proxy** (`src/proxy.ts`, Next.js 16's `middleware.ts` replacement) —
   refreshes the Supabase session cookie on every request and applies coarse
   signed-in/signed-out route rules from `src/lib/auth/routes.ts`.
   Convenience only, never trusted, never the source of an authorization
   decision.
2. **Server guards** (`src/lib/auth/guards.ts`) — every protected page and
   server action re-verifies the user (`auth.getUser()`, server-validated),
   profile state, org memberships, platform-admin status, and MFA assurance
   level (aal) against the database. For organization owners/managers and
   platform admins, MFA is mandatory: `enforceMfaVerified()` independently
   redirects to `/mfa-enroll` (no factor yet) or `/mfa-challenge` (factor
   enrolled, session not yet aal2) — every sensitive server action calls
   this again immediately before writing, never relying on a page-level
   redirect alone.
3. **Row Level Security** — every table is default-deny; policies and
   triggers in `supabase/migrations/` are the final authority. Even a bug in
   the app layer cannot read or write another tenant's rows, and even a
   `SECURITY DEFINER` function that bypasses RLS (like
   `create_organization_with_owner()`) independently re-checks the JWT's
   `aal` claim. See `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md` for the full MFA/AAL model.

## Supabase Integration

- `env.ts` — Public env accessors. Placeholders are allowed only in
  development/test; production/staging fail fast at startup if
  unconfigured (and require https URLs).
- `client.ts` — Browser client (`@supabase/ssr` `createBrowserClient`),
  anon key only.
- `server.ts` — Per-request server client bound to the request's cookies.
  All queries run as the signed-in user under RLS.
- `database.types.ts` — Typed schema (kept in sync with migrations;
  regenerate with `supabase gen types typescript --local`).
- Service-role usage is not present in the app. Privileged operations
  (e.g. granting platform admins) happen via migrations or operator
  tooling outside the Next.js bundle.

## Explicitly Out of Scope (Phase 2)

- Payment processing, SMS, Mapbox/maps
- Menus, live locations, loyalty, reviews, promotions, billing, ambassadors
- Organization member invitation UI (DB policies exist; UI in a later phase)
- Admin moderation tooling (secure `/admin` shell only)

## Environment Configuration

Separate example files are provided for local, staging, and production:

- `.env.local.example` (includes local Supabase CLI values)
- `.env.staging.example`
- `.env.production.example`

See `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md` for credential handling rules.
