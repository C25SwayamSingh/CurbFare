# Security Model

## Credential Handling

### Public (browser-safe)

These variables may be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` and referenced from client bundles:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV`

### Server-only (never in browser code)

These must **never** be imported into client components or exposed via `NEXT_PUBLIC_`:

- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` — used server-side only (`src/lib/geocoding/google-places.ts`)
  to verify a vendor's city/state via a proxied API route; never sent to the browser
- Any payment provider secret keys (future phase)
- Any SMS provider credentials (future phase)

The Phase 2 application code never uses the service-role key. Privileged
operations (granting platform admins) happen via migrations or operator
tooling, outside the Next.js app.

### Fail-fast environment validation

`src/lib/supabase/env.ts` allows placeholder values only when
`NODE_ENV` is `development` or `test`. In any other environment, missing
Supabase configuration throws at startup, and non-https Supabase URLs are
rejected. A production deployment can never silently run half-configured.

## Supabase Access Patterns

| Context                              | Client module                 | Key used                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Browser / Client Components          | `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`  | Anon key only                        |
| Server Components / Actions / Routes | `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`  | Anon key (RLS as the signed-in user) |
| Privileged admin operations          | Migrations / operator tooling | Service role key (never in app code) |

Sessions are cookie-based via `@supabase/ssr`. Server code always verifies
the user with `auth.getUser()` (validated against the auth server), never
the unverified local session payload.

## Role Hierarchy

| Role              | Source of truth                         | Scope                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anonymous         | no session                              | Public pages only                                          |
| Customer          | Any onboarded user (always available)   | Own profile, customer dashboard                            |
| Vendor access     | Active `organization_members` row       | Vendor dashboard and org-scoped data                       |
| Vendor onboarding | No membership yet                       | Profile, MFA, org creation flows                           |
| Staff             | `organization_members.role = 'staff'`   | Own membership + own org basics                            |
| Manager           | `organization_members.role = 'manager'` | Org roster; manage staff/managers (never owners)           |
| Owner             | `organization_members.role = 'owner'`   | Full org management                                        |
| Platform admin    | `platform_admins` row                   | Cross-tenant read + future moderation; requires MFA (aal2) |

`preferred_mode` controls navigation and default post-login destination only.
Vendor authorization comes exclusively from active organization membership
(and platform admin rows). The deprecated `account_type` column is retained
for safe migration but cannot be changed by clients.

Optional **passkeys (WebAuthn)** may be added later via Supabase experimental
support — see `src/features/authentication/actions.ts` and auth forms; the
current email/password flow remains the stable default and is structured so
passkey sign-in can be added without rewriting authorization guards.

### Platform admin design decision

Admin status lives in the dedicated `platform_admins` table — **not** in
profile fields, URL params, client state, or user-editable auth metadata.
The table has no insert/update/delete policies and revoked write grants for
`anon`/`authenticated`; rows can only be created via migrations or the
service-role key. `requirePlatformAdmin()` additionally requires an
MFA-verified (aal2) session.

## Tenant Isolation (RLS)

RLS is enabled on every table; the default is deny. Policy intent:

- **profiles** — users read/update their own row; co-members of an active
  shared org can read each other (for rosters); platform admins read all.
  No public/anonymous access; no client-side insert/delete. A trigger blocks
  changes to `id`, `created_at`, and any change to `account_type` (deprecated).
  Users may update `preferred_mode` (UI only).
- **organizations** — visible only to active members and platform admins.
  Updates: owners only, and protected fields (`created_by`, `id`,
  `created_at`) are trigger-locked. No insert policy: creation only via
  `create_organization_with_owner()`. No delete policy: archive via status.
- **organization_members** — members see their own rows; owners/managers see
  their org's roster; no cross-org visibility. Inserts: owners (any role) or
  managers (never `owner`); never for yourself; `invited_by` must equal the
  acting user. Updates/deletes: owners manage all; managers manage non-owner
  rows; anyone may leave. Triggers additionally block self role changes and
  demotion/removal of the final active owner (ownership transfer required).
- **platform_admins** — self-read only; no writes from app roles.
- **MFA-mandatory writes** — restrictive policies backed by
  `mfa_assurance_ok()` require an **unconditional** aal2 session for every
  organization update and organization-member insert/update/delete. Because
  only owners/managers can ever pass the corresponding permissive policy
  (`has_org_role(...)`) in the first place, this makes MFA mandatory — not
  optional — for those roles, entirely at the database layer (see "MFA"
  below for why this changed from the original "only if enrolled" behavior).

### SECURITY DEFINER functions

Every DEFINER function pins `SET search_path = public, pg_temp`, validates
`auth.uid()`, never accepts trusted role/org claims from the client, and
documents in-code why DEFINER is necessary (RLS recursion avoidance or
privileged reads such as `auth.mfa_factors`). Execute grants on
`create_organization_with_owner` are limited to `authenticated`.

`create_organization_with_owner()` bypasses RLS entirely (it runs with the
function owner's privileges), so the restrictive MFA policies on
`organizations`/`organization_members` never apply to it. It therefore
performs its own explicit `auth.jwt() ->> 'aal' = 'aal2'` check before doing
anything else — the only way to close that bypass for a DEFINER function.
Without this, initial organization creation could never be gated by MFA no
matter how the table-level RLS policies were written.

`protect_membership_update()` and `protect_membership_delete()` are also
SECURITY DEFINER (required to count active owners org-wide without RLS
recursion). Inside DEFINER functions, `current_user` is the function owner
(`postgres`), not the API caller. Protections that must apply to
`authenticated` clients therefore gate on `current_setting('role', true)`
(which Supabase and the pgTAP harness set to `authenticated`/`anon`), not on
`current_user`. Migration `20260704000000_fix_membership_definer_triggers.sql`
closed a bypass where self role changes and final-owner deletion were not
blocked for API clients.

## MFA (Supabase TOTP) — optional at signup, mandatory for sensitive actions

MFA is **optional** for customers, staff, and for organization owners/
managers creating an account or using the dashboard, and **mandatory** for
organization owners/managers performing sensitive management actions and
for platform administrators (always). There is no custom, client-writable
"is MFA verified" flag anywhere in the system — every check reads Supabase
Auth's own `aal` (Authenticator Assurance Level) claim, which only the TOTP
challenge/verify APIs can ever set to `aal2`.

| Role                   | MFA requirement                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer               | Optional                                                                                                                          |
| Vendor staff           | Optional (for now)                                                                                                                |
| Organization owner     | Optional to create an org and use the dashboard; **mandatory** before sensitive management actions (org settings, member changes) |
| Organization manager   | Optional to use the dashboard; **mandatory** before manager-level sensitive actions                                               |
| Platform administrator | **Always mandatory** — every admin-level read/write requires aal2                                                                 |

### Enrollment / challenge flow

- Enrollment, challenge, verification, and unenrollment use Supabase's TOTP
  APIs exclusively (`supabase.auth.mfa.*`) — no custom crypto, no custom
  verification state.
- `getAuthContext()` (`src/lib/auth/guards.ts`) loads `aal` and `mfaEnrolled`
  fresh on every request from
  `supabase.auth.mfa.getAuthenticatorAssuranceLevel()` — never from client
  state, cookies, or profile fields.
- `enforceMfaVerified(ctx, nextPath)` is the mandatory-MFA gate used where
  MFA is actually required: if the session is not aal2, it redirects to
  `/mfa-enroll` (no verified factor yet) or `/mfa-challenge` (a factor is
  enrolled but this session has not verified it). Both pages return to
  `nextPath` (validated by `safeNextPath()`) once the step is complete.
- **Vendor onboarding sequence** (`resolveVendorOnboardingPath`): 1) choose
  the vendor path (`/onboarding`) → 2) complete the personal profile
  (`/onboarding/vendor/profile`) → 3) create the organization atomically
  (`/onboarding/vendor`) → 4) vendor dashboard (`/vendor`). None of these
  steps require MFA — `requireVendorForOrgCreation` and
  `requireVendorDashboard` only require an authenticated session.
- **MFA as a dashboard suggestion**: owners/managers without a verified
  session see a suggestion banner on `/vendor` linking to
  `/account/security`, where the existing self-service `MfaEnrollment` flow
  lives — the same component used by `/mfa-enroll`.
- **Sensitive management actions**: `requireVendorSensitiveAction()` remains
  mandatory-MFA for owners/managers performing org-settings or
  member-management writes (not yet wired to any shipped UI as of this
  writing — the DB policies and guard are ready for when that UI ships).
- Platform admins: `requirePlatformAdmin()` requires aal2 unconditionally;
  `/admin` is unreachable without it. The database's `is_platform_admin()`
  also requires aal2, so any other policy using that function (profiles,
  organizations, organization_members reads) also stops recognizing an
  unverified admin session, independent of the app layer. Unrelated to and
  unaffected by the owner/manager creation/dashboard change above.
- Unenrollment of a **verified** factor (self-service, `/account/security`)
  requires an aal2 session.
- Recovery: the manual TOTP secret is shown only on demand (hidden by
  default) during enrollment and is never logged or persisted outside the
  Supabase enrollment response; account-recovery options are surfaced via
  Security settings rather than advising users to retain the raw secret. An
  admin-assisted factor reset is future work (service-role tooling).

### Independent, defense-in-depth enforcement

Frontend redirects are a UX convenience only — every layer that _does_
require MFA re-verifies independently so a bypass at one layer alone cannot
grant access. This applies to sensitive management actions and platform
admin, not to org creation or dashboard access (both stay MFA-optional:
fake-vendor risk is handled by the reviewed application flow that gates
membership itself, not by an authenticator at the door). Non-members
touching a vendor URL are sent to `/customer` — vendor onboarding starts
only from the explicit listing flow:

1. **Page guards** (`requireVendorSensitiveAction`, `requirePlatformAdmin`)
   redirect before rendering.
2. **Server actions** independently call `enforceMfaVerified()` (or an
   equivalent guard) immediately before every sensitive write — the
   required entry point for member-management, organization-settings,
   loyalty-configuration, customer-data-access, and billing-administration
   actions once built.
3. **Database** — restrictive RLS policies (`mfa_assurance_ok()`) require an
   aal2 JWT for organization/membership writes. A request that somehow
   skipped both app layers still cannot write.

Organization creation (`create_organization_with_owner()`) requires only an
authenticated, confirmed-email session — no MFA layer at any of the three
points above. It's `SECURITY DEFINER` and bypasses RLS entirely, which is
why it never had a restrictive-policy layer in the first place; the app-
and DB-layer aal2 checks it previously had were removed together.

### Sensitive operations requiring AAL2 (current and architected-for)

- Updating organization settings (RLS ready; no settings UI yet)
- Inviting/adding/removing members, or changing member roles (RLS ready; no
  invitation UI yet)
- Assigning or removing manager/owner roles (RLS ready)
- Future: loyalty configuration, customer-data access, billing
  administration — must use `requireVendorSensitiveAction()` server-side and
  an AAL2-gated RLS policy at the database level when built.

Creating an organization is **not** in this list — it requires only an
authenticated session (see above).

## Application-layer protections

- **Open redirects** — `next`/redirect params validated against same-origin
  absolute paths (`src/lib/auth/redirect.ts`), including protocol-relative
  and backslash bypass tricks.
- **Mass assignment** — server actions write only whitelisted columns;
  authorization fields are additionally trigger-locked at the DB.
- **IDOR / cross-org** — all queries run under RLS as the signed-in user;
  IDs from the client cannot widen access.
- **Duplicate submissions** — submit buttons disable while pending;
  org creation is idempotent (existing owners are redirected, plus a unique
  slug constraint and unique live-membership index).
- **Email enumeration** — password reset always reports success; sign-up
  does not reveal whether an email already exists.
- **Auth email links (PKCE)** — local Supabase recovery emails carry PKCE
  tokens; password-reset `redirectTo` must target `/auth/callback` (code
  exchange), not `/auth/confirm` (`token_hash` OTP verification).
- **Validation** — all inputs re-validated server-side with Zod; the DB
  function re-validates again.
- **Error handling** — raw auth/database errors are logged server-side;
  users see generic, safe messages.

## Authorization Test Matrix

Enforced by `src/lib/auth/guards.test.ts` (server guards, mocked) and
`supabase/tests/001_rls_policies.sql` (database policies + AAL enforcement,
51 pgTAP assertions).

"MFA required" means the role holds the necessary permissions but the
database's restrictive `mfa_assurance_ok()` policy blocks the write until
the session is aal2 — this is enforced identically whether the write comes
from the app or a direct database request.

## Environment Separation

| Environment | Config file                         | Purpose                |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Local       | `.env.local`                        | Developer machines     |
| Staging     | `.env.staging` / hosting secrets    | Pre-production testing |
| Production  | `.env.production` / hosting secrets | Live users             |

Never commit real secrets. Example files (`.env.*.example`) contain placeholders only.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs lint, typecheck, unit tests, and E2E tests. No
production secrets are required for CI; tests use placeholder Supabase
configuration. Database policy tests (`npm run db:test`, `npm run db:lint`)
require a local Supabase stack (Docker-compatible container runtime) and are
run by developers — see `supabase/tests/README.md`. They are not currently
part of the CI pipeline because CI runners in this environment do not have a
container runtime available; adding a `docker`-capable CI job to run
`npm run db:reset && npm run db:test && npm run db:lint` is recommended
follow-up work.

## Known Limitations

- The 46 pgTAP assertions in `supabase/tests/001_rls_policies.sql` are
  ready to run but require a local Docker-compatible stack — see
  `supabase/tests/README.md` for exact commands and current status.
- Manual end-to-end testing of the live auth flows (real sign-up email via
  Mailpit, real TOTP challenge, etc.) also requires that same local stack.
- Member invitation/management UI and organization-settings UI do not exist
  yet — the RLS policies and `requireVendorSensitiveAction()` guard are
  ready for them, but there is no current page/action exercising them
  end-to-end.
- Admin-assisted MFA factor recovery is not implemented (would require
  service-role tooling outside the app).

## Loyalty Checkout Identification

Full model in `docs/decisions/loyalty-system.md` §10. Security-relevant
invariants:

- The dynamic customer QR carries an opaque 256-bit token and nothing else —
  no identifier, contact detail, or balance. Only its **SHA-256 digest** is
  stored, so no database reader can reconstruct a scannable code.
- Sessions are one-time, expire in 5 minutes, and are bound to one customer
  and one organization. Consumption and the ledger insert happen under a
  single `FOR UPDATE` lock in one transaction, keyed for idempotency by the
  session id.
- The 4-digit fallback is a lookup handle, never an authenticator. Ten failed
  4-digit lookups per staff account per org per 10 minutes throttles further
  attempts; five failures against one session locks it. The QR path is not
  throttled — a 256-bit token is not guessable, and limiting it would only
  strand vendors.
- Failed identifications are **returned as outcomes rather than raised**, so
  the audit row survives the transaction the rate limiter depends on.
  Authorization violations still raise and abort.
- Secret columns (`code`, `numeric_code`, `token_digest`) are excluded from
  the `authenticated` column grant — they are reachable only through
  SECURITY DEFINER functions, never over PostgREST.
- Camera access is requested only on an explicit tap, frames never leave the
  device, and every exit path stops all MediaStream tracks.
- The permanent printed vendor QR encodes only a public URL and cannot award
  anything; it routes, nothing more.

## Out of Scope (This Phase)

- Payment processing and PCI-related flows
- SMS delivery and phone verification
- POS integration (staff still enters the verified eligible subtotal)
- Admin moderation tooling (secure shell only)
